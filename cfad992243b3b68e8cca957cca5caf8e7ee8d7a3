Because this now includes \u0027/\u0027 in the matching group, it now looks like an absolute path (\u0027/gitiles-server\u0027), so all of the path.exists checks below now fail.\n\nI guess the simplest fix is to do m.group(1).lstrip(\u0027/\u0027), but I\u0027d like to understand the problem better.",
