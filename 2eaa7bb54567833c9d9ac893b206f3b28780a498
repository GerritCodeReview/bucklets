      "message": "If I build the plugin, I know that plugin.jar will be at the root of buck-out folder. This artifact is the result of the build, not an intermediate artifact.\n\nI am trying (maybe not the right way) to do the same thing but for the plugin-sources.jar. My goal is to produce the plugin-sources.jar next to plugin.jar so I can get them both without knowing the location of the intermediate artifact.\n\nBefore this change, if I use java-sources in my plugin BUCK file, the result is an intermediate artifact located in lib__\u003cjava_sources_name\u003e__output folder. With this change, the result is a build artifact at the root of buck-out folder.\n\nAre you suggesting to keep the java_sources bucklet as is(without this change) and add another one(gerrit_plugin_sources?) to produce a source jar that is a build artifact?",

You may want to take a look at gitiles project, where I added the support to deploy JAR|SRC|DOC combination to Maven Central, without (!) knowing the location of the intermediate artifacts. Basically buck $(location :target) macro can be used to retrieve the location of intermediate artifacts from Buck.",

I need the source jar to deploy with the plugin jar in Artifactory. I cannot use maven_package to deploy directly into Artifactory, I need to tell the Jenkins Artifactory plugin where are the jars(including sources) to deploy. \n\nI will look at gitiles project, thanks for the info!",
